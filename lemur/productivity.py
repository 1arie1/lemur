"""
Round-productivity statistics for `lemur nla` summary view.

Each `core::check` round in nla_solver concludes with a trace line of
the form

    sz = N, m_to_refine = K STATUS

inside a `[nla_solver] patch_monomials_on_to_refine` block, where:

  * N = m_to_refine queue size at start of round
  * K = m_to_refine queue size at end of round
  * STATUS ∈ {less, same, more} — sign of K - N

For each trace we compute:

  * **Productivity rate** = `less` rounds / classified rounds.
    Macroscopic round-level success: fraction of rounds where the
    queue actually shrunk.
  * **Eviction yield** = (sum of N-K over `less`/`same`/`more`
    rounds) / total ~lemma_builder emissions. Per-lemma utility in
    monomials/lemma units. The proposal's empirical table on the
    kvault VC: bad-seed ≈ 0.24, good seed ≈ 0.60, winner ≈ 0.67 —
    sharper signal than productivity rate, but in unfamiliar units.

Both default-on as `lemur nla TRACE` summary lines once parsing is
wired. Help text frames this as a per-instance exploration tool, not
a general-purpose verdict; thresholds (0.35 / 0.40) are tentative on
N=3 traces from one VC.

See ../z3-research/lemur/burst-stats-proposal.md (the v1 burst-stats
postmortem and v2 productivity pivot) for the empirical table.
